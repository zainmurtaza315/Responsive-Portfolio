        <p class="info">
          My name is Zain Murtaza and I have long had a passion for web
          developement. My passion for web developement started years ago when I
          wanted my voice to be heard and creativity to be dislayed. However,
          just like most developers, my passion for web developement started
          from an atypical place; blogging. Blogging was a hobby of mine that
          developed through my vast interests in sports. Sports such as
          Basketball and Baseball eventually led me on the journey of coding,
          which resulted in my first website.
