        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="info">
          My name is Zain Murtaza and I have long had a passion for web
          developement. My passion for web developement started years ago when I
          wanted my voice to be heard and creativity to be dislayed. However,
          just like most developers, my passion for web developement started
          from an atypical place; blogging. Blogging was a hobby of mine that
          developed through my vast interests in sports. Sports such as
          Basketball and Baseball eventually led me on the journey of coding,
          which resulted in my first website.

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
          Attending the University of Toronto had provided me with a vision of
          the career I wanted to pursue. Throughout my undergraduate studies I
          had taken many courses that hovered around the topic of programming.
          However, my quest in becoming a programmer was unfufilled at UTM. What
          UTM did teach me however, was the core disciplines a programmer must
          have in order to prosper. Patience, perserverence, and determination.

    <h2 class="outside">Ambitions</h2>
    <p class="outter">
      I strive to be the best programmer one can be. For this to be
      accomplished, I acknowledge that this takes discipline, hard work,
      perserverence, and patience.Over the years, I have come learn that these
      may be some of the core values each developer must have to reach the
      mountain-top of the vast potential of programming. However, my ambitions
      do not stop at learning, rather specializing in a few programming
      languages. I continually strive to learn and improve on a daily basis.
